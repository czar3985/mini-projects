**1. Break Timer**

Description: This program can run on the background while a user is doing work on the computer. When it's time for the user to take a break, the program opens up a video on the web browser and plays a song as a signal to the user to pause his work.

Script: `break_time.py`

Notes: Customizable parts of the code are time between breaks, number of interruptions for the entire session and video that opens up to signal break time.

Current defaults:
```
timeBetweenBreaks = 3600 ## Time in seconds 
numCycles = 3 ## Number of interruptions 
url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w" ## Shark Dance video
```
